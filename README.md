# GitRepo 

----------------------------------------------------------------    Question 1 : ----------------------------------------------------------------  

process : 

step 1 : Created a GIT-ASSIGNMENT repository by using pycharm
                           |
step 2 : In that repository I created Assignment-1 directory and write python code by using pycharm
                           |
step 3 : After write code and i check Commit history of GIT ASSIGNMENT repository with git status command
                           |
step 4 : After check git status I openend the file and made some extra lines  to it
                           |
step 5 : Then git status -- it is modified 
                           |
step 6 : use git add . and after that git commit -m commands to commit
                           |
step 7 : Then clone the repo from Github to local repo by copying url and entering git clone <url>
                           |
step 8 : then git fetch -- fetch the changes
                           |
step 9 : After that git pull changes from remote repo to local by using git pull 

-------------------------------------------------------------     Question 2 : ------------------------------------------------------------------------
process :

step 1: I cloned the repository GIT-ASSIGNMENT reporitory created in Github by using git clone and pasted the url 
                                |
step 2: I created Assignment-2 directory after that I create a branch1(new branch )
                                |
step 3: switch the branch from main to branch1
                                |
step 4: And added python comment lines in the local copy
                                |
step 5: Then commited changes to the branch1 by using git commit -m "committed"
                                |
step 6: then switch back to main (branch) by  git switch main
                                |
step 7: After that merged the changes to new branch by using git merge branch1
                                |
step 8: finally i push the code main (original branch) by git push origin main

---------------------------------------------------------------  Question 3 : ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

process :

 * created one feature branch 
          |
 * Made changes in the code
          |
 * pushed the python code
          |
 * created pull request
          |
 * resolved conflicts with gitrebase

-------------------------------------------------------------- Question 4 : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

process :

     1] created feature branch as Feature_branch1
     2] switched to Feature_branch1
     3] Made changes in python code and made multiple commits
     4] identified Hash history by git log and copy particular hash id 
     5] Applied the cherry pick to commit2 hash id 
     6] finally push the code
------------------------------------------------------------  Question 5 : -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

process :

     a) created feature branch as Feature_branch2
     b) switched to Feature_branch2
     c) Made multiple commits to the python code [python-5.py]
     d) Reset to previous Second commit by using hash id
     e) Reverted to another commit4
     f) Finally checked the git log and successfully revert the previous changes to python code comment lines
